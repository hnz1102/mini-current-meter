# Mini Current Meter - Mini Size High-resolution Digital Power Monitor and Logger

This tool provides a logging function that captures data on voltage, current and power consumption. Voltage input range is from 0 to 35V, maximum current input is 10A. 

# Features

**High-resolution** - By using Texas Instruments INA228 IC - 20-bit delta-sigma ADC, it can obtain measurement data with 195ÂµV bus voltage and 163.84mV shunt voltage resolution.

**Microcontroller on board** - No need for a client PC when measuring. Data is sent directly to the server.

**Transfer measurement data via WiFi** - This logger can transfer data to a Linux PC via WiFi network and you can view the dashboard graph in InfluxDB.

**Calibration Function** - Built-in calibration functionality with persistent storage. Long press the center button for 2+ seconds to perform automatic calibration that corrects voltage and current measurement offsets. Calibration results are automatically saved to non-volatile storage and restored on power-up.

**Change Channel** - This logger allows you to change the measurement channel by pushing the center button with a pin. Once you push the center button, the channel will change to the next channel. The channel cycles through 1, 2, 3, 4, and back to 1.

**Battery Powered** - Uses LiPo battery. It can run for 12 hours on a single charge. The battery is charged via USB Type-C port.

**Mini Size** - The dimensions are 37mm(W) x 67mm(D) x 55mm(H). It can be used in various locations.

# How to Use the Logger

![PinOut](doc/pinout.png)

This meter has a pin socket with three pins: VBUS/VIN+, GND, and VIN-. The VBUS/VIN+ pin is connected to the voltage input or the current input. The GND pin is connected to the ground of the voltage or current input. The VIN- pin is connected to the load side of the voltage or current input.

![How to connect](doc/howtomeasure.png)

DO NOT CONNECT WITH REVERSE POLARITY BETWEEN VBUS/VIN+ AND GND. IF CONNECTED INCORRECTLY, THE ADC IC WILL BE DAMAGED.

The measurement interval time is fixed at 100ms. Each measurement data is sent to the server every 1 second.

The display shows the current voltage, current, power consumption, battery voltage, buffer consumption, WiFi connection status, and channel number.
If the WiFi Access Point cannot establish a connection, the display will not show the WiFi indicator. If voltage is measured while WiFi is not connected, the data is stored in the logger's internal memory buffer. The buffer that is not being sent to the server is indicated by a buffer bar on the display. When the buffer is full (the bar reaches the right edge of the display), measurement stops automatically. When WiFi is connected and data is transmitted to the server, the buffer bar shrinks to the left. When the buffer is full and measurement is stopped, measurement will resume automatically after the buffer drops below 50%.

If you send data to the server, you can see real-time data using the Dashboard in [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/influxdb/). If you have 3 meters, you can view data on the dashboard with different channels simultaneously.

These meters are small and light, so you can use them in various locations. For example, you can use them to measure circuit current on your breadboard, or you can measure the current at each measurement point on your breadboard circuit.

To charge the battery, simply connect to a USB Type-C port from a bus-powered USB port. During charging, the CHG LED is RED. After charging is complete, the FUL LED is GREEN and charging will stop automatically. However,

DO NOT CONTINUE CHARGING IF THE BATTERY IS FULL FOR A LONG TIME.

# Calibration Function

The Mini Current Meter includes built-in calibration functionality to correct measurement offsets and improve accuracy.

## How to Perform Calibration

1. **Prepare for calibration**: Ensure no current is flowing through the shunt resistor and no voltage is applied to the measurement inputs (VBUS/VIN+ and GND should be at the same potential).

2. **Start calibration**: Press and hold the center button for **2-5 seconds**. The display will show "Calibrating..." message.

3. **Calibration process**: The device automatically takes 300 samples over 3 seconds to calculate average voltage and current offsets.

4. **Completion**: When calibration is complete, the display will show "Calibration OK" for 2 seconds, and the offset values will be automatically saved to non-volatile storage.

## Button Functions

- **Short press** (< 2 seconds): Change measurement channel (1-4)
- **Long press** (2+ seconds): Perform calibration

## Calibration Features

- **Automatic offset correction**: Calibration corrects both voltage and current measurement offsets
- **Persistent storage**: Calibration results are automatically saved to NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) and restored on power-up
- **High accuracy**: Uses 300-sample averaging for precise offset calculation
- **User feedback**: Real-time status display during calibration process

## When to Calibrate

- **Initial setup**: Perform calibration when first using the device
- **Temperature changes**: Recalibrate if operating temperature changes significantly
- **Accuracy concerns**: If measurements appear to have a systematic offset
- **After firmware updates**: Recalibration recommended after major firmware changes

**Note**: Always ensure zero current flow and zero voltage difference during calibration for best results.

# Recent Updates
